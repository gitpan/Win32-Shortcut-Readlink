This is the Perl distribution Win32-Shortcut-Readlink.

Installing Win32-Shortcut-Readlink is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm Win32::Shortcut::Readlink

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S Win32::Shortcut::Readlink

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan Win32::Shortcut::Readlink

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build && ./Build test

Then install it:

    % ./Build install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo ./Build install

## Documentation

Win32-Shortcut-Readlink documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc Win32::Shortcut::Readlink
